-ISP {ISP stands for Internet Service Provider which is a term used to refer to a company that provides internet access to people who pay the company or subscribe to the
company for the same}
-DNS RESOLVER {The DNS resolver for the ISP finally has the IP address that the user needs. The resolver returns that value to the web browser. The DNS resolver also 
caches (stores) the IP address for example.com for an amount of time that you specify so that it can respond more quickly the next time someone browses to example.com.}
-HTTP REQUEST METHOD {HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be
performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs}
-HTTP REQUEST STATUS CODE {HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:
Informational responses ( 100 – 199 ) Successful responses ( 200 – 299 ) Redirection messages ( 300 – 399 )}
-HOW TO CHECK IP FROM CMD {First, click on your Start Menu and type cmd in the search box and press enter. A black and white window will open where you will type 
ipconfig /all and press enter. There is a space between the command ipconfig and the switch of /all. Your ip address will be the IPv4 address.}
-PORTS {The port property sets or returns the port part of the href attribute value. The href attribute specifies the destination of a link in an area. Note: If the
port number is not specified in the URL (or if it is the scheme's default port - like 80, or 443), some browsers will display 0 or nothing.}
